Explore in first person view a procedurally generated world in two modes:

Mode Infinite: The world is infinitely generated. New parts of the world is generated in the direction of the player's movement. The level of detail of meshes further away is less than those closer. 

Mode Normal: A large explorable terrain littered with cats that follow you when you get close to them. Press "R" to generate a new terrain. Also includes a Day/Night Cycle.
